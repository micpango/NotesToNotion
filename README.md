# Notes To Notion

Notes → Notion is an ambient AI agent that turns handwritten notes into structured, actionable entries inside Notion — automatically.

You drop a photo into a folder, and it understands tasks, questions, and topics, then appends them as real Notion blocks with a semantic timestamp.

It removes the friction between analog thinking and digital execution.
